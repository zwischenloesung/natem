# Natem

This tool was build to help access thoughts and concepts organized as a
bunch of [YAML](https://yaml.org) files following the
[JSON/YAML schema](http://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-validation.html) of
[tsunki knowledge base](https://gitlab.com/zwischenloesung/tsunki_example).

Sounds scary? It's not. YAML is made for you to easily read and write data that
can also be easily understood by machines. The rest is done with a little magic
from the ***uwishin***'s toolbox.

It got it's name from
[natem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca),
the medium provided by the ***uwish√≠n***
(shaman) to access the flow of wisdom of
[tsunki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunki).
(Disclaimer: we do not want to imply that this software really
interacts with the actual shuar deity, nor do we want to make
fun of the mystical world in any way. We just think this beautiful
analogy is fitting very well and we belief to see a common
structure of human sensemaking.)


## Goal / Idea
